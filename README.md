# Vehicles and Drivers Management System CARPAL Backend

## Overview
The backend of the CARPAL application is built using Spring framework in Java. It serves as the server-side component responsible for handling data storage, retrieval, and management operations related to vehicles and drivers. The backend communicates with the frontend to provide a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** - Core programming language for backend development.
- **Spring Framework** - Provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications.
- **Spring Boot** - Simplifies the process of building stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- **Spring Data JPA** - Provides an easy and efficient way to implement data access layer for JPA repositories.
- **Spring Web** - Supports building web applications using Spring MVC and provides RESTful services.
- **MySQL** - Database management system for storing and managing data.

## Features
- Provides RESTful APIs for managing vehicles and drivers data.
- Implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for vehicles and drivers.
- Utilizes Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
- Ensures data integrity and consistency through Spring Data JPA.
- Supports seamless integration with the frontend for a cohesive user experience.

## Installation
To set up the backend locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
3. Set up a MySQL database and configure the connection details in the application properties.
4. Navigate to the backend project directory.
5. Build the project using Maven.
6. Run the application.
7. The backend server will start running on the specified port.

## Usage
- Once the backend server is up and running, the frontend application can communicate with it to perform various operations, or it can be tested using postman.
- The frontend will interact with the provided RESTful APIs to manage vehicles and drivers.
- Users can perform actions such as adding, editing, deleting, and viewing details of vehicles and drivers through the frontend interface.
- Ensure that the frontend application is configured to communicate with the backend server.
